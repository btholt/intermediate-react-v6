Add this to the scripts:\n\n```json\n\"scripts\": {\n  \"build\": \"vite build\",\n  \"start\": \"node ./server.js\"\n},\n```\n\nIn the project root, create an index.html\n\n```html\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html lang=\"en\">\n  <head>\n    <title>SSR Example</title>\n    <script async defer type=\"module\" src=\"./Client.js\"></script>\n  </head>\n  <body>\n    <div id=\"root\"><!--ROOT--></div>\n  </body>\n</html>\n```\n\n> ðŸ’¡ We're doing vanilla JS again, but it's easier now to add JSX if you want to. Vite has `--ssr` flag you can add to compile an app for use w/ React doing SSR. We're not covering it today but feel free to try later.\n\nCreate an App.js, put in there:\n\n```javascript\nimport { createElement as h, useState } from \"react\";\n\nfunction App() {\n  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);\n  return h(\n    \"div\",\n    null,\n    h(\"h1\", null, \"Hello Frontend Masters\"),\n    h(\"p\", null, \"This is SSR\"),\n    h(\"button\", { onClick: () => setCount(count + 1) }, `Count: ${count}`)\n  );\n}\n\nexport default App;\n```\n\nNow create a Client.js file\n\n```javascript\nimport { hydrateRoot } from \"react-dom/client\";\nimport { createElement as h } from \"react\";\nimport App from \"./App.js\";\n\nhydrateRoot(document.getElementById(\"root\"), h(App));\n```\n\nThis is code that will _only_ execute in the browser. If you have Google Analytics or local storage or anything like that, you'd do those sorts of things that _need_ to happen in the browser but don't need to be run in Node.js. Specifically, hydrateRoot will only run on the browser and can't run on the server.\n\nNow for the spicy bit, let's do server-side rendering\n\n```javascript\nimport fastify from \"fastify\";\nimport fastifyStatic from \"@fastify/static\";\nimport { readFileSync } from \"node:fs\";\nimport { fileURLToPath } from \"node:url\";\nimport path, { dirname } from \"node:path\";\nimport { renderToString } from \"react-dom/server\";\nimport { createElement as h } from \"react\";\nimport App from \"./App.js\";\n\nconst __filename = fileURLToPath(import.meta.url);\nconst __dirname = dirname(__filename);\n\nconst shell = readFileSync(path.join(__dirname, \"dist\", \"index.html\"), \"utf8\");\n\nconst app = fastify();\n\napp.register(fastifyStatic, {\n  root: path.join(__dirname, \"dist\"),\n  prefix: \"/\",\n});\n\nconst parts = shell.split(\"<!--ROOT-->\");\napp.get(\"/\", (req, reply) => {\n  reply.raw.write(parts[0]);\n  const reactApp = renderToString(h(App));\n  reply.raw.write(reactApp);\n  reply.raw.write(parts[1]);\n  reply.raw.end();\n});\n\napp.listen({\n  port: 3000,\n});\n```\n\n> If you're getting hydration errors, you may have a whitespace problem (I did when writing this.) React is _super_ sensitive to anything being different between client and server. I had to make sure that `<div><!--ROOT--></div>` had no newlines in it.\n\nThe interesting part is the \"/\" get handler. We immediately write the head to the user. This allows the browser to see the script tag and immediately start downloading the React app. We then render the app and send it to the user. This means by the time the app is rendered and sent to the user, it'll be pretty close to the time the user finishes downloading the script and should get a faster time to first meaningful pain and a decent time to interactive. We finish it off by sending the rest of the closing tags to the user.\n\n> We did this with renderToString.
